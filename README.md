ParamOS is a basic operating system made using Cosmos OS Kit in Visual Studio (C#/.NET). The command line OS has five commands: ‘namaste’ for greetings, ‘about’ to learn more about ParamOS, 'gui' to load the Graphical User Interface (GUI), ‘restart’ to reboot the OS and ‘shutdown’ to shut down the computer.
